# Courier System

The Courier System project is developed using C++ and implements various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for managing courier operations. It includes functionalities such as  managing sender and receiver details, and finding the shortest path between cities.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Utilizes an adjacency list to represent cities and their connections with distances.
- **Customer Management**: Allows input and display of customer details including name, house number, area, and city.
- **Path Finding**: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and check connectivity between cities.
- **User Interface**: Command-line interface for user interaction and operation selection.

## Setup

To compile and run the Courier System project:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Compile `Source.cpp`, `Customer.h`, and `Graph.h` together using your preferred IDE or command-line compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## Usage

- **Main Menu Options**:
  - Option 1: Print the graph of cities and their connections.
  - Option 2: Enter sender and receiver details.
  - Option 3: Print sender and receiver details.
  - Option 4: Check if a path exists between two cities.
  - Option 5: Find the shortest path between two cities.
  - Option 0: Exit the program.

## Example Usage

```plaintext
$ ./CourierSystem.exe
Enter Option: 1

```
